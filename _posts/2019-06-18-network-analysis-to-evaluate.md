title: "Paper: Network analysis to evaluate the impact of research funding on research community consolidation"
---

A [new paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0218273) by myself and three UC Davis collaborators (David Coil, Carl Stahmer, and Jonathan Eisen), "Network analysis to evaluate the impact of research funding on research community consolidation," has just been published in *PLOS One*.  This paper will most be of interest to the science policy, science of team science, and bibliometrics communities.  

**Abstract**:  

In 2004, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation launched a new program focused on incubating a new field, “Microbiology of the Built Environment” (MoBE). By the end of 2017, the program had supported the publication of hundreds of scholarly works, but it was unclear to what extent it had stimulated the development of a new research community. We identified 307 works funded by the MoBE program, as well as a comparison set of 698 authors who published in the same journals during the same period of time but were not part of the Sloan Foundation-funded collaboration. Our analysis of collaboration networks for both groups of authors suggests that the Sloan Foundation’s program resulted in a more consolidated community of researchers, specifically in terms of number of components, diameter, density, and transitivity of the coauthor networks. In addition to highlighting the success of this particular program, our method could be applied to other fields to examine the impact of funding programs and other large-scale initiatives on the formation of research communities.
